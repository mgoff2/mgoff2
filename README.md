- Hi, I’m Marcus Goff, a data analyst, statistician, math teacher, and armchair philosopher/economist/psychologist/cognitive scientist/etc. in Atlanta, GA. I am a data analyst at Crown Castle, just to my north in Alpharetta, GA. 
- I’m interested in AI/ML, particularly in NLP, computational mathematics, and multi-modal models that support cognitive model-building alongside language processing development. 
- I’m currently learning how to _really_ use HuggingFace-related models, as well as a bit of graph theory, organic chemistry, systems engineering, stochastic processes, and whatever else catches my interest. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to the intersection of data analytics, health, behavior, and economics | Kaggle competitions | NLP | cognitive modelling | automated essay grading | math education and visualization | complex and dynamical systems | 
- I'm inspired by Douglas Hofstadter, Steven Pinker, Benoit Mandelbrot, Gary Marcus, Phillip Tetlock, 3Blue1Brown/Grant Sanderson, Salman Khan, Mary Oliver, James Gleick, Kalid Azad,  Steven Strogatz, Project Euler, Dover math textbooks, Behavioral Economics, Kazuo Ishiguro, Cormac McCarthy, Siddhartha Gautama, and so, so many others.
